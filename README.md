## Viola: a fiddle for GWT

Hosted code samples, compiler as a service. RelaxFactory webserver, CouchDB storage for files and data.

### Current short term TODO list:

 * Add support for common GWT widget libraries (GXT, GQuery, mgwt, etc - please suggest more!)
 * Make it easier to edit projects you own, and fork projects you don't
 * Full text search (currently prefix search)
 * List metadata on example pages (author, title, description)
 * Show log while compiling

### Longer term changes:

 * Support multiple versions of GWT and libraries
 * Dramatically improve IDE
 * Support downloading project sources in standard formats (maven, eclipse, intellij)
